# 10EQS Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is designed to help small business owners track their product pricing against market conditions. It integrates internal pricing data with external pricing sources and generates actionable insights.
Since it's for a Challenge, it gathers the information from a dummy site (having limitations on the retrieved information insights and the actual calculations made for the recommendations)

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Install required dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Ensure `products.csv` is placed in the correct directory:
  ```
  C:/Users/Kmger/OneDrive/Bureau/karenina/10eqs-data-analysis/data/products.csv
  ```

### Running the Script
To execute the analysis and generate insights, run:
```bash
python analysis.py
```
This will:
1. Load internal pricing data from `products.csv`.
2. Fetch external product pricing data from an API.
3. Compare internal vs. external pricing and generate insights.
4. Save results to `report.md`.

## API Keys/Credentials handling
The current implementation integrates a public test API key for demonstration purposes. The selected external data source (https://dummyjson.com/products) does not require authentication, but the code is structured to handle API keys securely if needed.
If integrating with a real-world API that requires authentication, API keys should be stored in a .env file and loaded securely using environment variables to prevent exposure in public repositories. The script automatically retrieves the key from the environment, defaulting to a public test key if none is provided.

## Approach
1. **Data Ingestion**: Load internal product pricing from a CSV.
2. **External Data Integration**: Fetch product pricing from an "API".
3. **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Normalize and clean product names.
4. **Price Comparison**: Calculate the difference between internal and external prices.
5. **Reporting**: Save insights into a structured markdown file.

## Known Issues & Limitations
- **Dummy Data Source**: Since this project is developed as part of a challenge, it retrieves information from a placeholder API. This may limit the depth of insights and the accuracy of recommendations, as the external data does not reflect real-world market conditions.
- **Product Name Mismatch**: If external product names differ significantly, matching accuracy may be reduced.
- **API Data Variability**: External pricing may change over time, affecting analysis consistency.
- **Performance Consideration**: If datasets grow larger, enhancements may be needed to optimize data processing and improve execution efficiency.

## Time Spent on Each Component
| Component                     | Time Spent |
|-------------------------------|------------|
| CSV Data Handling             | 10 min     |
| Data Cleaning & Preprocessing | 35 min     |
| Price Comparison & Insights   | 30 min     |
| Report Generation             | 15 min     |
| Adding API KEY feature        | 15 min     |
| Debugging & Testing           | 50 min     |
| CSV as an argument            | 15 min     |
| Documentation & README        | 30 min     |
| **Total**                     | **3 hrs**  |
*Aproximated times

## Future Possible Enhancements
- **Improved Price Comparison:** Enhance the external price comparison by integrating real-time pricing data from multiple sources instead of using a fixed multiplier (This will allow for more accurate competitive analysis and better pricing strategies.)
- **Expanded API Integration:** Explore additional data sources, such as e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon, eBay, Walmart APIs), to gather real-time market prices and trends.
- **Dynamic Insights & Alerts:** Implement automatic alerts when significant price gaps are detected, helping businesses optimize their pricing strategies dynamically.
- **Data Visualization:** Add interactive charts and dashboards to make pricing trends more accessible and actionable for business owners.
- **Historical Price Analysis:** Store and analyze historical price data to identify trends and predict future pricing fluctuations.
